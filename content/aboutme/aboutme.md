- **Current Focus**:  
  - Backend systems (Go, GRPC, Python, Java, FastAPI)
  - DevOps pipelines (Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS Lambda)
  - Software testing and CI/CD

## 💻 Technical Interests

- Building secure, scalable APIs
- Infrastructure as Code and cloud-native deployments
- Applying formal testing strategies (ECP, decision tables, path coverage)
- Exploring reinforcement learning and intelligent systems

## 🚀 Projects in Motion

- 🧭 **Despatch Advice API**: Dockerized, deployed on AWS Lambda + RDS  
- 🔁 **Task List API with gRPC**: Learning Golang, Protobuf, and CI/CD hands-on  

## 💡 Personal Philosophy

I'm a **poet by passion**, **philosopher at heart**, and **engineer by discipline**. I love exploring the deep questions of existence, humanity, and what lies beyond — and I bring that sense of meaning and intentionality into my work.
