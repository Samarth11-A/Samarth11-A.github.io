# 📋 gRPC Task List API

A simple yet powerful backend API built in **Go** using **gRPC**, designed to manage a persistent task list with clean architecture, strong typing, and CI/CD integration. This project serves as a hands-on introduction to building scalable microservices using modern backend practices.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of **Go**, **Protocol Buffers**, and **gRPC**
- Apply software engineering principles like modular design and testability
- Build a production-style CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**
- Explore containerization, deployment, and version control best practices
